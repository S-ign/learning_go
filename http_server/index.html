		<h2>Tapenade (Olive Spread)<br></h2>
		<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend.
				Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h2> Ingredients: </h2> 
		<ul>
			<li> 1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes </li>
			<li> 2 large garlic cloves </li>
			<li> 2/3 c. kalamata olives </li>
			<li> 1 t. capers </li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Instructions: </h2>
		<p>
			Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible.
			Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated,
			but still retain some texture. Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).

			<h2> Low and Slow </h2>
			<p>
				This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In sous vide cooking,
				you submerge the food <small>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</small> into a water bath that is precisely set to the
				target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<br><b>Cooking for Geeks</b>, <cite>Jeff Potter</cite> describes it as ultra-low-temperature
				poaching.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next month, we will be serving <em>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</em>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.

				<strong> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon <em>is not pasteurized</em>. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.  </strong>
